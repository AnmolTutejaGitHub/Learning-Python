# Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain this Python `for` loop to you!

# In Python, a `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and perform some operations on each element of the sequence. Let's break down the loop step by step using the given code:

# ```python
# st = "print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters"

# for word in st.split():
#     if len(word) % 2 == 0:
#         print(word + " is even!")
# ```

# 1. `st` is a string containing the sentence you provided.
# 2. `st.split()` is used to split the string into a list of words. By default, it splits the string at spaces, creating a list of words.
# 3. The `for word in st.split():` line initiates a `for` loop that iterates over each word in the list of words created by splitting the string.
# 4. `word` is a variable that represents each individual word in the list during each iteration of the loop.
# 5. The indented block of code below the `for` statement is the body of the loop. It contains the following `if` statement:
#    - `if len(word) % 2 == 0:` checks if the length of the current word (number of letters) is even. This is done by calculating the remainder of the division of the length of the word by 2. If the remainder is 0, then the length is even.
# 6. If the condition `len(word) % 2 == 0` is `True` for a particular word, the indented code block inside the `if` statement is executed:
#    - `print(word + " is even!")` prints the word followed by the string " is even!".

# So, the loop iterates through each word in the sentence, checks if the length of that word is even, and if it is, it prints out the word followed by " is even!".

# For example, when the loop encounters the word "word" (which has 4 letters), the condition `len(word) % 2 == 0` is `True`, so it prints "word is even!". The same process happens for other words with even lengths.
